# Enthusiast

This is a fork of [Enthusiast][enth] ([original repository][enth-repo]) by [@geekish][me]
intended to ensure compatibility with modern versions of PHP,
and fix any security issues or bugs that may come up.
At this time there is no plan to add new features.

Enthusiast is a tool for (fan)listing collective owners to easily maintain their listing collectives and listings under that collective.
For a full list of features Enthusiast offers, please read [More About Enthusiast][enth-features].
For more information about fanlistings and [The Fanlistings Network][tfl], see [TFL 101][tfl-101].
